# To Sum Up

- A balanced diet is necessary for good health. 

- Carbohydrates and fats give us energy while proteins help to repair the worn out tissues
of our bodies. Vitamins and minerals protect us from illness. 

- Roughage and water are important parts of a balanced diet. 

- We must cook and preserve food in such a way that nutrients are not lost. 

- Diseases can either communicable  or non-communicable 

_ Lack of nutrients in the diet causes deficiency diseases.

- The brain is made up of the cerebrum, the cerebellum and the medulla. 

- Nerves carry messages to an from the brain and spinal cord. 

- There are three types of nerves - sensory, motor and mixed. 

- Reflex actions are automatic reactions of our body. The breain is not involved. 

- Our sense organs supply us with information about our surroundings.

## D. Answer the following questions

1. Name the three organs of the nerves system that control information. 


        i. Sensory Nerves
        
        ii. Motor Nerves
        
        iii. Mixed Nerves



3. What are parts of the brain? Explain their functions. 

The parts of the brains are 

    i. The Cerebrum: It is the thinking part and controls voluntary movement, learning, intelligence and memory. It also helps us to understand the signals that we get from the sense organs. 
  
    ii. The Cerebellum: It is in charge of movement and helps to maintain the balance of the body. 
  
    iii. The Medulla: It controls the heartbeat, breathing, blood circulation, digestion and other involuntary actions like sneezing, swallowing and so on. 

4. Explain the difference between sensory and motor serves. 

Sensory Nerves: These nerves carry messages from the muscles and sense organs to the brain or spinal cord. The brain undestands what the organ has seen, heard, felt, smelt or tasted. 

Motor Nerves: These nerves carry messages from the brian or the spinal cord to the muscles. The brain instructs the muscles on how to act. For example, if your hands are cold, the brain sends a message that makes you put your hands in your pocket. 

5. Explain reflex action with an example. 

When we accidentally touch something hot, we automatically draw our hand back. such actions that we perform without thinking are examples of relex actions.

# Chapter 8: Soil and Its Importance

---
## To Sum UP

- Soil is an important natural resource. 

- It is formed by the weathering of rocks over a long period of time. 

- Soil is very important to both plants and animals. 

- Sand, clay and loam are the basi types of soil found in nature. 

- The soil in any area has three layers: topsoil, subsoil and bedrock or parent rock. 

- Soil erosion takes place when the topsoil is washed away due to natural and human factors. 

- We must conserve soil by using methods like afforestation, terrace farming, contour ploughing and planting shelter belts. 


---

## Test Your Learning

1. Weathering of rocks is _____________

a. the breaking up of rocks into smaller pieces. 

2. The part of the soil that is made of decayed plant and animal material is 

d. humus

3. The type of soil that holds a large amount of water is 

b. loam

4. An activity that leads to soil erosion is 

b. cutting trees

5. Which of the following will stop soil erosion

b. planting more trees and plants


---
## Answer the following questions

1. List the things that social contains.

Answer: Soil contains the following things
        - rocks and minerals
        - dead and broken plants and  animals (make soil fertile. 
          This material is called ***humus***)
        - water and air
        - small worms and insects
        - small organisms like bacteria
        

2. Why is loamy soil used for growing plants? 

Loamy soil is made of sand, silt and clay. Since it holds water and nutrients better than sandy social and drains better than calyey soil, it is often used for growing plans, gardening and agriculture. 


---

3. What are the layers of soil? Explain their properties with a diagram

There are there layers of soil

- Topsoil : It is the topmost layer of soil and has sand and clay. It is rich in humus. It has many nutrients and holds water. It also contains air. 

- Subsoil: this layer contains pieces of rock and is less humus. It has less water and air than top soil. 

- Bedrock : This layer (also called **parent rock**) is mainly made up of large pieces of rock. Bedrock supports the upper layers of the soil. 


---

4. How have humans increased soil erosion? 

Human have increase social erosion by deforestation i.e. cutting down trees, overgrazing by cattle and ploughing of farmlands. 


5. How can soil be conserved

Soil  can be conserved by the following methods

- Afforestation i.e. by planting more trees. 

- Using soil cover by growing grass or covering the land by dry grass.

- Contour ploughing: It is a method of ploughing that follows the curves of the land. This slows the water flowing down and stops the soil from being washed away. 

- Terrace farming : It is practised on the slopes of the mountain. Fields are cut into the sides of mountains to look like step. These steps slow the flow of water down the slope, preventing soil erosion. 

- Growing shelter belts: Bushy plants are grown along the edges of fields to stop the wind from blowing away the soil.

## Answer the following questions

1. Describe the surface of the Moon. 

The surface of the moon is rocky and is covered with craters and mountains. 

2. Why is life not possible on the Moon? 

The life is not possible on the moon because it has no atomosphere. It is very hot during the day and very cold at night. 


3. What do you understand by the phases of the Moon? 

During its revolution around the Earth, the Moon appears to change shape. The changes are called the phases of the Moon. 

4. Describe with a neat diagram how a solar eclipse occurs. 

During its revolution around the Earth, the Moon comes between the Earth and the Sun. When the three objects are in a straight line, the shadow of the Moon falls on the Earth and prevents us from seeing the Sun. This is called solar eclipse. This occurs on  a New Moon day. 


5. What are the uses of artificial satellites? 

Satellites are used for the purpose of communication, remote sensing, weather forecasting, education and so on.
